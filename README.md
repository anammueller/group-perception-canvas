# Group Perception Canvas – Subjective Bonding Toolkit

This open-source tool allows researchers to measure **subjective social closeness (bonding)** in group-agent interactions using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Participants can arrange circles representing themselves, the agent, and other group members to indicate how close they felt during an interaction.

Developed and field-tested in a large-scale in-the-wild study at a museum this toolkit is lightweight, customizable, and easily embedded into survey platforms such as SoSci Survey (Germany) [https://www.soscisurvey.de].

## 🔍 Background & Motivation

While many tools in Human-Agent Interaction research focus on physical proximity or objective metrics, subjective social closeness remains underrepresented — especially in **group contexts**. Inspired by the IOS (Inclusion of Other in the Self) scale, the **Group Perception Canvas** allows participants to **visually indicate their felt closeness** to socially interactive agents (SIAs) and peers.

This canvas was developed as part of a doctoral research project investigating bonding in group-agent interactions (GAI) and was deployed in tablet-based surveys after museum interactions with a robot and a virtual agent.

## 🛠 Features
